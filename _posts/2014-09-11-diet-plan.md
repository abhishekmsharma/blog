Currently (as of September 11, 2014) my weight is <strong>70 kilograms</strong>, and it was as much as much as <strong>99 kilos</strong> almost <strong>10 months back</strong>.  Losing weight was not easy, but it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. After having success on losing weight efficiently, I decided to share my eating routine with my readers.

I am <strong>21 years old </strong>(as of 2014), and hence this diet plan should ideally suit<strong> teenage boys, or men who are in their early-20s</strong>. Others may try this out as well, after all it is the human body, and the nutrition it needs remains similar in most cases.

<strong>Prerequisites for following the diet plan</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A heavy body (why read further if you do not fulfill this)</li>
	<li>Self-control</li>
	<li>Patience</li>
	<li><em><strong>Determination (Most Important)</strong></em></li>
</ul>
And if determination is what you lack, have a look at the image below to get inspired.

So, let us begin with the diet plan!

<strong>Early morning (empty stomach):</strong> A glass full of <strong>hot/lukewarm water </strong>with honey and lemon

<strong>Breakfast (strictly after bath):</strong> One cup of milk with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Britannia 5 grain biscuits</span></strong> or <strong>Marie Digestive (3-4 biscuits)</strong> with a <strong>banana/boiled egg/egg omelet</strong> (and I am not paid by Britannia or Marie to say this)

<strong>2-3 hours after breakfast:</strong> Fruits (avoid Chikoos and Bananas here). <strong>Apples </strong>highly recommended.

<strong>Lunch:</strong> Salad consisting of <strong>Cucumber</strong> and/or Tomatoes. 2<em> chapatis</em> <strong>without ghee</strong> and any traditional <em>sabzi</em> or <em>dal</em>. Have <strong>sprouts</strong> at least <strong>twice a week</strong>.

<strong>Evening snacks:</strong> A glass of <strong>milk</strong> or a vegetable <strong>soup</strong> with some <strong>salad</strong>. Some days<strong><em> khaakra</em></strong> or diet <strong><em>chivda</em></strong> will also do.

<strong>Dinner (try having it before 9pm):</strong> 2<em> chapatis</em> <strong>without ghee</strong> with any traditional <em>sabzi</em> or <em>dal</em>.

<strong>Additional Points:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid fried food items.</li>
	<li>Avoid cheese, butter, and sweets (basically sugar) as much as possible.</li>
	<li>Drink lot of water. This may sound funny but make drinking water a hobby. Drink water when you are bored, even if you are not thirsty.</li>
	<li>Don't drink water within 30 minutes of having breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</li>
	<li>Avoid eating at unusual times.</li>
	<li>Avoid drinking cold water.</li>
	<li>Avoid rice as much as possible, and prefer removing starch from rice before eating.</li>
</ul>
I followed this diet plan with absolutely <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ZERO EXERCISE</strong></span> and it worked flawlessly for me. I hope you follow it and it helps you in reducing your extra kilos too.

<em>All the best. Happy dieting!</em>
