Currently (writing this on September 11, 2014),¬†my weight is <strong>70 kilograms</strong> (approx. 154 pounds), and it was as much as <strong>99 kilograms</strong>¬†(approx. 218 pounds) nearly <strong>10 months ago</strong>. ¬†Losing weight was not easy, but it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. After having success on losing weight efficiently, I have decided to share my diet routine with my readers.

I followed this diet when I was 20 years old, and hence this diet plan should ideally suit teenage boys, or men who are in their early-20s. Others may try this as well; after all it is the human body, and the nutrition it needs remains similar in most cases.

<strong>Prerequisites for following the diet plan</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A heavy body¬†(why read further if you do not fulfill this)</li>
	<li>Self-control (to avoid those junk food cravings)</li>
	<li>Patience (you are not gonna lose weight overnight)</li>
	<li><em><strong>Determination (Most Important)</strong></em></li>
</ul>
And if determination is what you lack, have a look at the image below. I hope you feel inspired.

So, let's begin with the diet plan!

<strong>Early morning (empty stomach):</strong>¬†A glass full of <strong>hot/lukewarm water </strong>with honey and lemon.

<strong>Breakfast (strictly after bath):</strong>¬†One cup of milk with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Britannia 5 grain biscuits</span></strong> or <strong>Marie Digestive (3-4 biscuits)</strong> with a <strong>banana/boiled egg/egg omelet</strong> (and I am not paid by Britannia or Marie to say this).

<strong>2-3 hours after breakfast:</strong> Fruits (avoid Chikoos and Bananas here). <strong>Apples </strong>highly¬†recommended.

<strong>Lunch:</strong> Salad consisting of <strong>Cucumber</strong> and/or Tomatoes. 2<em> chapatis</em> <strong>without ghee</strong> and any traditional <em>sabzi</em> or <em>dal</em>. Have <strong>sprouts</strong> at least <strong>twice a week</strong>.

<strong>Evening snacks:</strong> A glass of <strong>milk</strong> or a vegetable <strong>soup</strong> with some <strong>salad</strong>. On some days<strong><em> khaakra</em></strong> or diet <strong><em>chivda</em></strong> will also be fine.

<strong>Dinner (try having it before 9pm):</strong>¬†2<em> chapatis</em> <strong>without ghee</strong> with any traditional <em>sabzi</em> or <em>dal</em>.

<strong>Additional Points:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid fried food items.</li>
	<li>Avoid cheese, butter, and sweets (sugar) as much as possible.</li>
	<li>Drink lots of water. This may sound funny but make drinking water a hobby. Drink water when you are bored, even if you are not thirsty.</li>
	<li>However, don't drink water within 30 minutes of having breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</li>
	<li>Avoid eating at unusual times.</li>
	<li>Avoid drinking cold water.</li>
	<li>Try avoiding rice, and if that is difficult then remove starch from rice before eating.</li>
</ul>
I followed this diet plan with absolutely <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ZERO EXERCISE</strong></span> and it worked flawlessly for me. I hope you follow it and it helps you in reducing your weight too.

<em>All the best. Happy dieting!</em> üçé
